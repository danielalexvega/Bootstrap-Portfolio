                    <p>
                        Musician -- Teacher -- Learner -- Creative -- Sandwich Connoisseur -- Sound Engineer --
                        Basketball Enthusiast

                        In 5th grade, I overslept the morning of math triathlon auditions, and I didn't make the team.
                        It
                        was a real blow to my elementary ego, and so I regrettably joined the chess club instead. I had
                        a
                        pretty good season, and I think I only lost two matches. If it wasn’t cemented by then, it was
                        clear
                        to me now that I was a nerd; a badge I wear proudly still.<span id="dots">...</span>
                    </p>
                    <span id="more">
                        <p>
                            In middle school, I started playing percussion, and for the first time started to take music
                            seriously. I took private lessons, and then after eighth grade my parents bought me my first
                            drum
                            set. I don’t know how they functioned in that house, because drums are so loud, and I don’t
                            remember
                            ever playing soft; I was really into punk rock and started my first band my sophomore year,
                            while
                            still being very active in marching band at school.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Drums, and music to an extent, are very logical; there are time signatures, keys, tempos,
                            and
                            patterns. Lyrics and rhyme schemes are patterns, repetitions of sounds and syllables focused
                            on
                            some
                            theme. I started writing lyrics in high school, and I’m so thankful no one can read them;
                            I’m
                            sure
                            they were terrible, but they were a start.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In college, I majored in Sound Recording Technology, a degree program in the school of music
                            that
                            focused evenly on physics, music theory, and performance. The further I advanced into music
                            theory,
                            learning about chords and progressions, the more patterns I was exposed to. I created a band
                            called
                            Zlam Dunk with some friends, and we played a lot of shows, first starting in apartments that
                            would
                            be shut down by noise complaints, and eventually we were playing around Austin at clubs I
                            would
                            see
                            my favorite bands in. We made an EP, and two full length records, recording in studios
                            around
                            Austin. I even engineered and produced our last record, which was an amazing learning
                            experiment. We
                            went on three East Coast tours, playing multiple shows in New York City, Boston,
                            Philadelphia,
                            and
                            more. Touring in a van is simultaneously amazing and horrible, and figuring out where to
                            sleep
                            or
                            eat can be a nightmare, but you also meet the nicest people and make wonderful memories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After college, I continued to play music with bands, but quickly realized the life of a
                            musician
                            wasn’t going to allow me time to have a life outside of clubs and recording studios, and I
                            pivoted
                            towards education. I had flirted with the idea in college, and while working as temp in HR
                            at
                            Austin
                            ISD, the opportunity to earn an alternative certification presented itself, and in 2013 I
                            started
                            teaching high school math at the Alternative Learning Center, which is a discipline
                            alternative
                            education program. A true baptism by fire, reaching young adults who had been removed from
                            their
                            home schools due to drugs or gang behavior was a challenge, but I truly I thrived there. My
                            students
                            were punishing and challenging, but they were also sweet and kind and hoping to be heard; if
                            you
                            treated them with respect and tried to understand where they were coming from, they were the
                            same as
                            any student at any other school. They taught me a lot, and I miss working with them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you can imagine, working four years at an alternative school started to burn me out, and
                            eventually moved to McCallum High school, the fine arts magnet school for Austin. They asked
                            if
                            I
                            could teach AP Computer Science, and I knew I could learn. I got certified all while
                            finishing
                            Graduate School at the University of Texas. The next three years were my happiest in
                            education;
                            the
                            students at McCallum are quirky, creative, and hilarious. I taught some amazing students,
                            some
                            of
                            which were exceptionally intelligent, and pushed me to be a better teacher, to understand
                            concepts
                            deeper. My final year, I taught PreAP PreCalculus, PreAP Algebra 1, AP Computer Science, and
                            an
                            OnRamps Computer Science course. It was stressful, but immensely rewarding. After seven
                            years of
                            teaching, I have a new respect for thinking deeply on a subject. To teach anything you have
                            to
                            analyze a concept from several angles and really understand how it functions; I think the
                            ability to
                            do that will serve me well in my next career.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through it all I have continued to make music, forming a couple of bands to handle different
                            genres
                            and aspects of my personality. In 2020 I put out an EP I’d been working on for four years on
                            some of
                            my most personal music, and another single for another band that probably took six years to
                            make. I
                            find the pursuit of writing and recording music to be the main driving force; I don’t think
                            I’ll
                            ever produce a track as good as the ones my idols have, but it’s something I can keep trying
                            to
                            do.
